## NOTE: Forecast time refers to the ISOweek in which collection occurs, 
## not the precise day it occurs. (you don't want to predict the precise day).
## Thus a trap collection on 2016-01-01 occurs during ISO-week 2015-W53-1, 
## a.k.a. the week which began on Monday, 2015-12-28.
## In data files, all dates are given in standard ISO YYYY-MM-DD format, not
## in ISO week format.  

## NOTE: this creates forecasts only for those ISO-weeks which were observed in the sample data...

## Read in the target data.  
## NOTE: in general a forecast may instead be made directly from the 
## the raw data, and may include other drivers.  Using only the target
## variables for prediction is merely a minimal model.
