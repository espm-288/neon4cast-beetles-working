## Get the latest beetle target data.  
download.file("https://data.ecoforecast.org/targets/beetles/beetles-targets.csv.gz",

We need to fill in gaps within the sampling period and set non-sample timespans to zero
```{r}
# get a dataframe of the implicit gaps, 
# filter for big gaps that indicate the yearly sampling break for winter
# still not sure what to do with big gaps that indicate no sampling for more than a year 
gaps <- target_ts %>%
  count_gaps() %>%
  filter(.n > 10) %>%
  mutate(interval = interval(.from, .to)) %>%
  select(-c(.to, .from, .n))
  

target_fill <- target_ts %>%
  group_by_key() %>%
  fill_gaps() %>% #get all the time points that should exist but don't
  as_tibble() %>%
  full_join(gaps) %>% #get the interval data
  #get an indicator column that shows whether the date is in a winter interval for that site
  mutate(winter_samp = if_else(time %within% interval, TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  group_by(siteID, time) %>% 
  #if data is in any interval, treat it as a winter sample
  mutate(winter_samp = ifelse(sum(winter_samp) == 1, TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  select(-interval) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  # if it's winter, make abudance and richness 0 instead of NA %>%
  mutate(abundance = ifelse(isTRUE(winter_samp), 0, abundance),
         richness = ifelse(isTRUE(winter_samp), 0, richness)) %>%
  select(-winter_samp) %>% 
  group_by(siteID) %>%
  #interpolate all other NA's (within the sampling period) based on values that come before and after
  mutate(abundance = na.interp(abundance),
         richness = na.interp(richness)) %>%
  as_tsibble(key = siteID, index = time) %>%
  ungroup()

usethis::use_data(target_fill)
